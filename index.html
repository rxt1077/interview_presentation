                        ## Query of the Week

                        Imagine a database with the following schema, filled with historical closing stock prices:

                        ```sql
                        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS historical (
                            date DATE,
                            symbol VARCHAR(32),
                            price DECIMAL(10,2)
                        );
                        ```

                        What does this SQL do?

                        ```sql
                        SELECT price
                        FROM historical
                        WHERE symbol='IBM'
                        ORDER BY ABS(DATEDIFF(date, DATE(NOW() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR)))
                        LIMIT 1;
                        ```

                        ## Exercise 2

                        ### Setup

                        1. Open up git-bash, `cd` into the [IT635 repository](https://github.com/rxt1077/IT635) and do a `git pull`. This should update your repo with the new `Exercise 2`.
                        2. `cd "Exercise 2"` and run `vagrant up`. This will setup the virtual machine for this exercise.
                        3. `vagrant ssh` to get into the machine.

                    <h3>Scenario</h3>

                    <small style="text-align: left;">
                        You're a DBA for a medium sized school district (10K students). Recently you've won the "honor" of being
                        audited by NJQSAC. In one of your buildings the students may be over 18 years old and have the option of
                        signing themselves out. Unfortunately your Student Information System does not have a facility to keep
                        track of this. As such, the attendance secretary keeps the data in a "system of his own." The auditors
                        want you to run reports on how many students typically sign out each day and who is signing out. You reach
                        out to the secretary who emails you "sign_outs.zip" which you will find in the /vagrant directory of this VM.
                        Get the data into a sqlite3 database such that you can run useful reports on it.

                        the MOST. Please submit this in the Moodle assignment for this week.

                    <small style="text-align: left;">
                        Students pick a field that interests them and describe how they would use a database to solve a problem in that field.
                        The database should have a front end or scraping script for entering data and a reporting system for generating useful
                        results. Students must consider what type of database would be best for solving their problem and describe what
                        procedures / staff they would need to support it.

                    <small style="text-align: left;">                    
                        The specialty imports business requires a close working relationship with suppliers and customers. In this industry margins
                        are extremely tight and business usually relies on a series of long-term, trust-based relationships. As such, many specialty
                        import warehouses feel they do not need and sophisticated electronic inventory system. I propose to design a database for a
                        specialty import business that they can use to keep track of their inventory. The database will have a web front-end for
                        checking in deliveries and keeping track of shipments. It will also generate monthly reports that can be printed out. The
                        entire operation can be set up and run in the cloud and will maintain automatic backups. The selling point of this system is
                        that it can be administered remotely and does not require full-time IT staff. At the same time it is a custom system and can
                        be adapted to specific customer needs.
